# PG Phriday - The Code Behind the Postgres Blog

The PG Phriday PostgreSQL Blog has had many homes over the years:

* [Personal site](http://bonesmoses.org/tags/pg-phriday/)
* [2ndQuadrant](https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/author/shaun-thomas/)
* [EnterpriseDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/author/shaun-thomas)

Many of these articles contain SQL code for functions, views, or other handy items. This repository is an effort to collect these in a single place for reference and deployment where appropriate. In all cases, code has been sanitized and commented to explain the purpose and usage.

This is an ongoing effort and is currently backfilling based on past articles. If there is a particular entry you'd like to be expedited, let me know.

Enjoy!
